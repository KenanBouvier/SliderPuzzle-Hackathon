# SliderPuzzle-Hackathon

This was completed during a one day hackathon.

The problem:
  Given a "Klotski puzzle" also known as the slider puzzle - a 4x4 tile puzzle from numbers 1 -> 15 with an empty tile. 
  Create an algorithm that will solve this puzzle, i.e 1,2,3 ... 14,15 in order and keeps track of the moves the algorithm takes.
  
I have two files: the first being a very quick brute force solution (named Brute_force) but consequently is far too slow whilst the second is a much faster solution.
