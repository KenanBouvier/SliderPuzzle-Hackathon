#SliderPuzzle-Hackathon
This was completed during a one day hackathon.

#### The problem:  
Given a "15 puzzle" - a 4x4 sliding tile puzzle from numbers 1 -> 15 with the aim being to order all the numbers i.e. 1,2,3 ... 14,15. Create an algorithm that will solve this puzzle and find the sequence of moves to that final position.

I have two files: the first being a short brute force solution whilst the second is the much faster solution. I have attached the brute force solution as that is the backbone to understand the much faster solution.

#### NB: Many starting positions are not possible.  
Here is an article about the solvability and proofs on why many positions are not possible.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle#Solvability
